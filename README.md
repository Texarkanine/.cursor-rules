# Cursor Rules

A collection of cursor rules that I use.

You could use them, or your own, with the [ai-rizz](https://github.com/texarkanine/ai-rizz) tool.

## Structure

Individual rules are in [rules](./rules).

A "ruleset" is a directory full of symlinks to rules. Rulesets group logical, well, sets of rules.
