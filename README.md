# Cursor Rules

A collection of cursor rules that I use.

You could use them on your own, or with the [ai-rizz](https://github.com/texarkanine/ai-rizz) tool. You might also enjoy being able to [see them rendered as Markdown on GitHub](https://github.com/Texarkanine/client-side-mdc-render).

## Structure

Individual rules are in [rules](./rules).

A "ruleset" is a directory full of symlinks to rules. Rulesets group logical, well, sets of rules.
