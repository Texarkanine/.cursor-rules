# Active Context

## Current Focus
TDD Integration into Niko - Reflection complete

## Recent Decisions
- Main TDD rule (`always-tdd.mdc`) defines HOW; memory bank rules define WHEN
- Surgical trim of `build.md` to remove methodology duplication while preserving level-specific workflows
- "(after all phases complete)" clarification for integration testing placement

## Next Step
Run `/niko/archive` to create archive document and finalize the task.
