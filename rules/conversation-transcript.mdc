# Conversation Transcript Creation

This rule defines how to create comprehensive conversation transcripts that capture not just the dialogue, but also the full context of tool usage, decision-making processes, and implementation details.

## Pattern Description

### File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate both the project and the nature of the conversation:
- `[project-name]-transcript.md`
- `[feature-name]-conversation.md` 
- `[task-name]-development-log.md`

### Document Structure

```markdown
# [Project/Task Name] Transcript

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Human

[Full text of human message exactly as written]

---

## ü§ñ [AI Assistant Name]

**Context provided:**
- **Inline references**: `@file1.tsx`, `@component-guide.md`
- **Attached files**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`  
- **Manual selections**: Lines 15-20 from `Button.tsx`, terminal output showing build error

[Full text of AI response exactly as written]

[Tool call invocations and outputs - see format below]

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Human

[Next human message...]

---

[Continue pattern...]
```

### Participant Identification

- **Human**: Use üßë‚Äçüíª icon with "Human" (or specific name if requested)
- **AI Assistant**: Use ü§ñ icon with the specific assistant name (e.g., "Claude", "GPT-4", "Gemini")
  - **Why specific names matter**: Different AI assistants have different capabilities, reasoning patterns, and knowledge cutoffs. Attribution helps readers understand the context and capabilities involved.

### Explicit Context Documentation

For each AI response, document the **intentional context** the human provided:

#### Inline References
Files or rules explicitly mentioned in the message using `@` syntax:
- `@README.md` - Referenced inline for background information
- `@style-guide.mdc` - Referenced for coding standards

#### Attached Files  
Files added as context but not mentioned in the message text:
- `package.json` - Project dependencies context
- `LICENSE` - Legal context for the project

#### Manual Selections
Specific text/lines the human deliberately selected and included:
- Lines 15-20 from `Button.tsx` - Selected code showing the problem
- Terminal output showing fortune error - Selected error message
- Lines 646-648 from `posix-style-transcript.md` - Selected for comparison
- Lines 646-648 from `posix-style-transcript.md` - Selected for comparison

### Tool Call Output Handling

Different types of tool calls require different treatment:

#### Shell Command Tool Calls
**Include COMPLETE output** with tab indentation for safety:

```markdown
`run_terminal_cmd("git status")`

	On branch main
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
	
	Changes not staged for commit:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	        modified:   src/components/Button.tsx
```

#### File Reading/Search Tool Calls  
**Include output but truncate** to essential information:

```markdown
`read_file("src/config.ts", lines 1-50)`

[First few lines of actual content...]
[... content truncated for brevity ...]
[Last few relevant lines...]
```

#### Other Tool Calls
**Report invocation only**, exclude output:

```markdown
`edit_file("src/components/Button.tsx")`

`search_replace("package.json")`

`web_search("React best practices 2024")`
```

### Content Preservation Rules

1. **Exact Text**: Include the FULL text of all human and AI messages exactly as written
2. **No Summarization**: Don't summarize or paraphrase any dialogue
3. **Include Mistakes**: Preserve errors, corrections, and iterative refinements
4. **Preserve Formatting**: Maintain original markdown, code blocks, and formatting
5. **Tool Context**: Always include tool call invocations even when outputs are excluded
6. **Context Documentation**: Always document what explicit context was provided

### Tab Indentation for Command Outputs

Use tab indentation (not spaces) for command outputs to ensure markdown safety:

````markdown
`run_terminal_cmd("command")`

	output line 1
	output line 2
	code block within output stays safe:
	```
	nested code
	```
	more output
````

This prevents markdown parsing issues when command outputs contain code fences or other markdown syntax.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Start the transcript** with a clear title and first separator (`---`)
2. **Copy messages verbatim** - don't edit or improve the original text
3. **Document explicit context** for each AI response:
   - Inline references (files mentioned with `@`)
   - Attached files (provided but not mentioned)
   - Manual selections (deliberately chosen text/lines)
4. **Handle tool calls appropriately**:
   - Shell commands: Full output with tab indentation
   - File operations: Truncated output showing key content
   - Other tools: Invocation only
5. **Maintain consistent formatting** with icons and separators
6. **Use specific AI assistant names** rather than generic "Assistant"
7. **End with proper separator** after the final exchange

## Real-World Examples

* `@posix-style-transcript.md` - Complete example of a complex development process
* Shows proper tool call handling, decision-making preservation, and iterative development

## Common Pitfalls

* **Generic naming**: Using "Assistant" instead of specific AI name loses important context
* **Summarizing content**: Condensing messages loses valuable detail and reasoning
* **Missing context documentation**: Not recording what explicit context was provided
* **Inconsistent tool output handling**: Mixing full and truncated outputs inappropriately  
* **Missing separators**: Forgetting `---` dividers between exchanges
* **Space vs tab indentation**: Using spaces for command output can break markdown parsing
* **Incomplete tool context**: Not showing tool invocations when outputs are excluded
* **Editing original content**: "Improving" messages destroys the authentic record

## Advanced Considerations

### Large Conversations
For very long conversations, consider:
- Breaking into multiple files by logical phases
- Adding navigation comments for key decision points
- Including a summary section at the top (separate from the transcript itself)

### Sensitive Information
- Redact credentials, API keys, or personal information before saving
- Use placeholder text like `[REDACTED-API-KEY]` to maintain context
- Consider if the transcript should be committed to version control

### Collaborative Projects
- Include all participants in multi-person conversations
- Use distinctive icons/names for different team members
- Preserve the collaborative decision-making process

### Tool Evolution
As new tools are introduced, establish patterns for their output handling:
- High-value outputs (compilation results, test outputs): Include fully
- Routine operations (file creation, simple searches): Invocation only
- Debug/diagnostic outputs: Include selectively based on relevance

# Button Component Fix Transcript

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Human

Can you help me fix the styling issue in our Button component? I've been looking at `@style-guide.mdc` for reference. The padding seems wrong.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

**Context provided:**
- **Inline references**: `@style-guide.mdc`
- **Attached files**: `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`
- **Manual selections**: None

I'll help you fix the Button component styling. Let me first examine the current implementation.

`read_file("src/components/Button.tsx", lines 1-50)`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  // ... more props
}

function Button({ variant = 'primary', size = 'md', className, children, ...props }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button 
      className={cn(
        'px-2 py-1', // This looks like the padding issue
        variant === 'primary' && 'bg-blue-500',
        // ... more classes
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```
[... content truncated for brevity ...]

I can see the issue - the padding values `px-2 py-1` are too small. Let me fix this:

`edit_file("src/components/Button.tsx")`

Now let's test the fix:

`run_terminal_cmd("npm run test -- Button.test.tsx")`

	> my-app@1.0.0 test
	> jest Button.test.tsx
	
	 PASS  src/components/Button.test.tsx
	  Button Component
	    ‚úì renders with correct padding (23ms)
	    ‚úì applies size variants correctly (15ms)
	
	Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
	Tests:       2 passed, 2 total

Perfect! The tests are passing. The padding has been updated to use more appropriate values.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Human

Great! Can you also check if this change affects any other components that might be using similar patterns?

---

## ü§ñ Claude

**Context provided:**
- **Inline references**: None
- **Attached files**: None
- **Manual selections**: None

Good thinking! Let me search for similar padding patterns across the codebase:

`grep_search("px-2 py-1", include_pattern="src/components/**/*.tsx")`

`search_replace("src/components/Card.tsx")`

`run_terminal_cmd("npm run build")`

	> my-app@1.0.0 build
	> next build
	
	‚úì Creating an optimized production build
	‚úì Compiled successfully
	‚úì Linting and checking validity of types
	‚úì Collecting page and component data
	
	Build completed successfully!

All components have been updated and the build is successful. The padding fix has been applied consistently across the component library.

````

This example demonstrates:
- **Context documentation**: Shows what explicit context was provided for each response
- **Truncated tool calls**: `read_file()` and `grep_search()` with truncated output
- **Full shell command output**: Complete `npm run test` and `npm run build` results with tab indentation
- **No-content tool calls**: `edit_file()` and `search_replace()` showing invocation only
- **Back-and-forth conversation**: Natural dialogue flow between Human and the Assistant
- **Proper formatting**: Icons, separators, and consistent structure
