## Introduction

This rule demonstrates how to use GitHub-flavored markdown footnotes in Cursor project rules. Footnotes are useful for providing additional context or references without cluttering the main text.[^1]

## Pattern Description

- Use footnotes to add clarifications, references, or asides.
- Place the footnote reference in the main text, and the footnote definition at the end of the section or document.

Example:

```markdown
Here is a statement that needs clarification.[^clarification]

[^clarification]: This is the footnote text providing more detail.
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to define the footnote at the end of the document.
- Using non-standard syntax (Cursor supports GitHub-flavored markdown).
